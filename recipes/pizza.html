  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Toppings of your choice (pepperoni, vegetables, etc.)</li>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li> <strong>Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</strong> Punch down the dough and roll it out on a floured surface to fit a pizza pan.</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to the pizza pan. Spread pizza sauce over the dough, then sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and add your desired toppings.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
    <li>Remove from oven, let cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve.</li>
